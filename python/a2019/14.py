# initial idea was to first repeat the above process as many times as

# I don't know I felt smart about it.
# As good as binary search but harder to understand :)


# Basic idea:
# you have a certain amount of materials left over.
# a 'naive' approach would be to try to make one more fuel, then one more
# fuel, ...

# Instead, try to make 2*64 fuel.
# If it's possible, do it doing the minimum number of conversions.
# Then, try 2*63 ...

# minimum conversions, because if A -> 2B, it's as good if not better to have
# one A than 2B.

# this just means trying to use the ingredients you have
# before making more.

# but that's why repeating the part1 process as many times as possible first
# fails.
