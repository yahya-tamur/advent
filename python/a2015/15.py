# The ingredient matrix is very nice, and there might be a linear algebra
# solution. I thought of something for part 1, but part 2 is harder. The two
# conditions reduce the possibilities to a plane in R^4 but the function to
# optimize is nonlinear, so it's not easy, even if the matrix is diagonal.

# You could at least reduce the search space by getting two arbitrary values
# and solve for the last two using the two relations, but this is fast enough.
