# This was a lot of fun! I'm really happy with how it turned out.
# The parse and the run functions are merged so I don't have to copy 'units'.
# (And the input file is pretty small)
# Parsing by removing the extra parts was a good idea, and so was defining
# constants so 'unit's feel like structs without any additional complexity.
# Though why not just define a struct at this point?
